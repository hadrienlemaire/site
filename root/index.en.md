# Hi! Iâ€™m Hadrien. <span class="wave">ðŸ‘‹</span>

## Iâ€™m an engineer by training

I studied at [IPSA](https://www.ipsa.fr/en/){:target="_blank"}.
I have chosen the *Vehicule* major then I specialized in the *Space, Launchers &amp; Satellites* minor.

At school, I joined a [student society](https://ipsaspacesystems.wordpress.com/about/){:target="_blank"}
for which I was a member and then the treasurer from 2016â€¯to 2019.
I made a small rocket [Diamant](https://ipsaspacesystems.wordpress.com/diamant/){:target="_blank"}
and I participated to the [Perseus](https://www.perseusproject.com/){:target="_blank"} project.
Besides, I had the chance to take part in the launch campaign of
[SERAâ€¯III](https://www.perseusproject.com/sera/){:target="_blank"} at Esrange in Sweden.
